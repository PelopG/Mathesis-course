    "This is a small introduction to machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Wikipedia - machine learning is the study if computer algrorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, depending on the nature of the \"signal\" or \"feedback\" available to the learning system:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Supervised: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a \"teacher\", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical uses: classification and regression\n",
    "Classification is taking the data and categorizing them\n",
    "\n",
    "Example taking medical records and clasiffiing them as healthly or not healthy\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression the thing we would like to predict is not a category but rather a numerical value\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: We have as set of data for houses and we want to predict the price houses\n",
    "\n",
    "* Note: This is different from the regression we have seen in the other parts. (statistical regression)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Unsupervised: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical uses: clustering and dimensionality reduction\n",
    "Clustering: The task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). \n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction: is the transformation of data from a high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional space so that the low-dimensional representation retains some meaningful properties of the original data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Reinforcement learning: A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximize"

    "From the graph we can see 2 different classes (0&1)\n",

    "\n",
    "Now to which class does this point belong to? red or blue?\n",

    "What we want to do is to teach the computer how to thing based on the information found on the graph - most importanly being able to place a new point to the correct class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A solution to the problem is that we can seperate the graph by a line:\n",

    "\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "We set a (margin) which indicated the minimum distance of the line from the points\n",

    "Drawing now the 3 lines with there margins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which line do we select?\n",
    "\n",
    "We select the line with the maximal margin classifier - since it seperates our data in the best possible way\n",

    "A best fit line is affected by the point near it. The rest of the point do not really matter \n",

    "Most times our data do not contain only 2 dimensions but rather more and also more data\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We may need for example a line which is not affected so much by added points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence we now need a new algorithm that will now be affected too much by newly added points  - be more lenient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having done this we can see that the new line is much better that the previous one . Again the line is wrong but it much better than before\n",
