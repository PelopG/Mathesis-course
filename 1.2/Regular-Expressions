Regular Experssions:

Lets say for example you want to find all the telephone numbers in a dataset , or all the addresses.
For example in Excel or Word or anything in that matter you can use Ctlr+F (Find) to find a specific telephone number [ not ALL the telephone number ].

Hence in order to solve this problem we use regular expressions --> where we give a description of what we need to find.

Note: Regular expressions is a very imporant topic, therfore you can spend some time looking around the internet to find out more informations about it

A normal expression contains charactes & symbols in general
Most characters match their self 
Eg: an expression of test matches the expression of test

This is not always the case. 
There are some charactes which cannot be described by themselves.
. ^ $ * + ? { } [ ] \ | ( )

Lets see how the above characters are used

1) [ ] are used to indicate a character class
EG: [fgm]ood --> food,good,mood

2) - is used to indicate a range of characters
EG: [abc] --> [a-c]

Note: If for example in a character class we also have one of the special characters
EG: [akm$] --> Then we do not use the functionallity of $ but rather it is executed like (1)

4) ^ is used to select all the data except the expression found on the right
EG: [^5] select all the characters expect 5
EG: [^m]iss --> kiss,hiss,diss... all word NOT starting with letter m

Note: If the we have [5^] means either 5 or ^ [ losses its ability indicated in (4) ]

* 5) Most important character is \
EG: \d : [0-9]
EG: \D : [^0-9]
EG: \s : [ \t\n\r\f\v]
EG: \S : [^ \t\n\r\f\v]
EG: \w : [a-zA-Z0-9_]
EG: \W : [^a-zA-Z0-9_]

\f: formfeed
\n: linefeed
\r: carriage return
\t: tab
\v: vertical tab

6) . any character ; except enter

7) * 'greedy' repetition
EG: ca*t ==> ct(0),cat(1),caaat(3)..... 

8) + repetition only once ; NOT for 0 [ct]
EG: ca+t ==> cat(1 a)

9) ? match only 0 or 1
EG: home-?brew ==> homebrew OR home-brew

10) {} for a specific number of repetions
EG: a/{1,3}b ==> a/b, a//b, a///b

NOTE:
{0,} ==  *.

{1,} == +.

{0,1} == ?.

11) | means OR
eg: cat|dog ==> match cat OR dog

12) $ mathces a word at the end [ opposite version of ^ ]
EG: fear$  ==> [do not fear] NOT with [fear not]

Note:
\$ : match $ sign
210 \d{7} --> match telephone numbers beginning with 210 with 7 numbers
